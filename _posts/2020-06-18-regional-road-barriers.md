This report was tabled by the Victorian Auditor-General on 18 June 2020.

> This audit looked at whether Victoria’s regional road barriers program has met its intended safety outcomes. To do this, we focused on the flexible barriers installed by VicRoads on 20 high-risk rural roads, which is known as the Top 20 Program. We assessed the Transport Accident Commission (TAC) and VicRoads’ roles in planning, installing, maintaining and evaluating flexible barriers installed under the Top 20 Program.
