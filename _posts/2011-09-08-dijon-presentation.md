Abstract: I will describe diagrammatic tensor notation and introduce factorizing F-matrices. I will then present a diagrammatic representation of the factorizing F-matrix of Albert, Boos, Flume and Ruhlig, for the quantum spin chain with $sl(n)$ symmetry. This representation uses partial $F$-matrices, as in the construction of the $sl(2)$ factorizing $F$-matrix by Maillet and Sanchez de Santos, and leads to an easy proof of the factorizing property.
