Abstract: We consider quantum spin chains arising from \\(N\\)-fold tensor products of the fundamental evaluation representations of \\(\mathcal{Y}(sl_n)\\) and \\(\mathcal{U}_q(\widehat{sl}_n)\\). Using the partial \\(F\\)-matrix formalism from the seminal work of Maillet and Sanchez de Santos, we derive a completely factorized expression for the \\(F\\)-matrix of such models and prove its equivalence to the expression obtained by Albert, Boos, Flume and Ruhlig. A new relation between the \\(F\\)-matrices and the Bethe eigenvectors of these spin chains is given.
