Just when you thought bootstrap couldn't get any better:

> Abstract: We review bootstrap methods in the context of survey data where the effect of the sampling design on the variability of estimators has to be taken into account. We present the methods in a unified way by classifying them in three classes: pseudo-population, direct, and survey weights methods. We cover variance estimation and the construction of confidence intervals for stratified simple random sampling as well as some unequal probability sampling designs. We also address the problem of variance estimation in presence of imputation to compensate for item non-response.
