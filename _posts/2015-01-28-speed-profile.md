Abstract: The Defence White Paper 2009 instructed Defence to develop proposals to rationalise Australia's small vessel capability by replacing several classes of vessel with a single rerolable classâ€”the future Offshore Combatant Vessel (OCV) (Project SEA 1180). Global Positioning System (GPS) readings from current Armidale Class Patrol Boat HMAS GLENELG were combined with operational data and a heuristic categorisation method to provide speed profiles broken down by type of operation. The results of this study inform the future requirements through the generation of speed profiles using operational categorisation.
