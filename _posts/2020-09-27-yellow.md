An animated projection of a [tesseract](https://smcateer.github.io/) (a 4D generalizaion of a cube). The idea is that by playing with this and observing the shape as it moves, you might be able to get an intuition for the tesseract.

Have a play, see what you think. Feel free to fork the code and adjust it any way you like.

You can **click** or **move your mouth** to change the plane of rotation.
