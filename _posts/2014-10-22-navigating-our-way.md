Abstract: In the past few years evidence based decision making has become one of the catch cries of the big data phenomenon. This has seen both Google and Facebook efforts leading to open source software to analyse big data sets as part of the Hadoop ecosystem. Additionally, the role of data scientist has been declared as the sexiest job of the 21st century.

The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) has a vast array of information available via electronic navigational display systems. Amongst other things, this includes: position; velocity; water depth; weather information; and maritime traffic information. With recent Navy 2-star sponsorship, all vessels are required to submit their navigational log files to the Defence Science and Technology Organisation for analysis; this could amount to 1 terabyte of plain text data each year.

Demonstrating the value of this data, we have undertaken three rapid studies. The first study provided the RAN with analysis of patrol boat speed profiles categorized by activity. The second study concerned patrol boat wharf-space usage in Darwin. And the final study (ongoing) seeks correlations between navigational and meteorological data and precursors of hull damage. These studies contribute to evidence-based decision making for patrol boat replacement.

These examples lead to a discussion of military big data challenges in Australia, and the techniques we propose to overcome them. These include the use of big data techniques, heuristic methods for pattern recognition and statistical data exploration. Finally, we share our vision of how RANâ€™s future could be enhanced by embracing big data.
