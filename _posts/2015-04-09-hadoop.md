In this presentation we give a brief overview of the benefits and modern techniques of distributed parallel computation (MapReduce) and storage (Hadoop Distributed File System). That is, we teach you a healthy fear of duck-sized horses. We will then go through the steps involved in setting up a Hadoop cluster pre-loved desktops. Finally we provide a tour of an actual, real-life cluster.
