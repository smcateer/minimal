Telstra are a huge organisation with amazing data. Being in a tech industry, they are very open to change and new tools and techniques.

The focus on the customer experience was at the centre of everyting we did - hardly a meeting went by where it wasn't mentioned.

Below is a summary of some the work I was involved with during by time with there.

**Call Centre KPI Correlation**

* Investigation in to the KPIs used to incentivise staff
* Are the KPIs correlated? Could they be rationalized and simplified without sacrificing effectiveness?
* Tool: Python, statistical analysis

**ADSL Customer Satisfaction**

* Investigation into metro and rural ADSL customer satisfaction
* Counterintuitive results appeared to be related to customer expectation
* Tool: Python, statistical analysis

**Relationship Between NPS and Cycle-Time**

* Cycle-time is the time it takes from an activation or assurance episode to be completed
* We established that assurance and activation NPS have different cycle-time-dependence
* Tools: Pyhton, statistical analysis

**Plan Rationalization Studey**

* Do legacy mobile and internet plans have a greater assurance workload associated with them?
* Is the business case to rationalize the plans them supported?
* Tools: Python, statistical analysis

**Review of Contractor’s "Blended" Trial Analysis**

* An analysis of the impacts of a new operating model was conducted by the contractor porosing the model
* We conducted a review of the analyis conducted by the contractor
* Ultimately, we concluded that the trial did not achieve its aims
* Tool: Python, statistical analysis

**Extreme Weather Analysis**

* Can extreme weather events be foreseen and effectively mitigated through actions such as CT relocations?
* Study still under way when I departed Telstra
* Involved the use of publicly available data, and historical outage data
* Tools: Python

**Program Effectiveness Evaluation - Network Remediation**

* Analysis of effectiveness of network assurance programs (costing upwards of $200m)
* Communication of results to senior decision-makers
* Tools: Python, statistical analysis (black-spot fallacy)

**Start-of-Day Appointment Compliance Trial**

* Design and oversight of trial aimed at understanding which measures are effictive in improving start-of-day appointment compliance
* In a limited-scale trial, we discovered the effectiveness of various measures
* Findings helped design which measures would be taken forward
* Tools: trial design, analysis of results

**Regional Efficiency**

* Is there variation in the efficiency of various regions at completing certain tasks?
* Can this understanding be used to drive efficiency going forward?
* Tools: Python, statistical analysis

**Field Demand Variability**

* How large is the demand variability across regions?
* Is this enough to explain shortfalls in supply?
* Work was ongoing when I departed Telstra
* Tools: Python, statistical analysis

**Field Service Delivery (FSD) Budget Analysis**

* Root cause analysis of FSD budget outcome
* Review of demand forecast and how it is applied to budget process
* Tools: desktop analysis

**Fixed-Line Activation Cycle-Time v’s NPS**

* Analysis of the impact of changes in cycle-time on NPS
* Communication of results to seniors
* Tool: Pyhton

**Effectiveness of Exchange Remediation**

* Analysis of the effectiveness of exchange remediation on reducing assurance demand
* Results were interesting, but statistically insignificant
* Tools: Python, statistical anlaysis

Technical presentations:
* **Introduction to Jupyter**
* **NPS Parameter Estimation Techniques** – overview of methods including normality assumption, bootstrapping and a "trinomial" model
* **Introduced to Shiny (RStudio)**
