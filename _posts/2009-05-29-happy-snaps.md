Abstract: Complex valued functions are much talked about but rarely seen. But their graphs live in (something like) \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\), so how can we hope to see them? I will discuss one way to do this which produces some quite cute pictures - and can on occasion lead to some degree of insight.

(Talk given for the graduate student seminar series on 29 May 2009).
