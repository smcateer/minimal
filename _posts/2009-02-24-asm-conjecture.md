Abstract: I will discuss Kuperberg's alternate proof of the alternating sign matrix conjecture; that there are
\\[A(n) = \\frac{1!4!7!...(3n-2)!}{n!(n+1)!...(2n-1)!}\\]
alternating sign matrices of order \\(n\\). \\(A(n)\\) also ennumerates the totally symmetric self complimentary plane partitions of size \\(2n\\) and many other objects, but there is no known bijective proof of this fact.
