Abstract: I will discuss the result that the roots of a polynomial tau-function of the KP hierarchy obey a Hamiltonian system of Calogero-Moser type. On the one hand we have a function which describes waves propagating in a weakly dispersing medium; solutions to KP -- on the other we have a system of particles moving in time according to a particular Hamiltonian.
