Abstract: I will present an easily digested and elementary description of the algebraic Bethe Ansatz (ABA). This may be of particular interest to Stat Mech students/others who want an introduction to the topic. I'll start off from the very basics and describe the ABA using diagrammatic tensor notation. This will be a very informal session.

(This topic is discussed in detail in my [PhD thesis](https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/58978)).
