Abstract:
This report describes the development of the Auxiliary Library Explorer (ALEX) which was carried out as part of a DST Group summer vacation scholarship in 2013â€“14 by Alex Bunting. ALEX is a tool motivated by Google Scholar which uses the DST Group FOUO internal report database as its input. It provides DST Group researchers with an additional discovery capability and is available from the internal DST Group website. Since its development it has been used by hundreds of DST Group researchers.

(Alex won the award for best vacation project at DSTO Sydney in 2013-14.)
