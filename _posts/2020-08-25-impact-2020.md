Unfortunately earlier this year the Imapct 2020 conference was cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak.

I had planned on co-presenting with Xiaoyan Lu from ANAO on the use of stats, data science, data analytics (whatever you want to call it!) in government performance audit.

Our presentation, and the presentations of some of the other speakers can be found here: https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/impact-2020
