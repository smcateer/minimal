Abstract: The algebraic Bethe Ansatz is a method which is used to solve two dimensional lattice models such as the 6-vertex model. Over two sessions, I will introduce the key ideas and describe how the method works in specific cases. In the first session I will introduce the big picture, and in the second I will hone in on the details.

(Talk given over two weeks for the graduate student seminar series on 6 and 13 August 2010. The image is of Hans Bethe, who invented the method.)
