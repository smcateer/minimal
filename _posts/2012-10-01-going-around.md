Abstract: In this paper, we describe a heuristic method for the categorisation of paths in a timed geospatial data set. Based on their shape and speed, paths are categorised as ‘slow’, ‘straight’, ‘miscellaneous’ or ‘overlapping’. The method is demonstrated using Global Positioning System (GPS) data obtained from HMAS GLENELG during patrols and transits near Christmas Island. The method enables analysis and categorisation of paths without reference to an external data source (such as ship’s logs) which explicitly indicates activities over time.
