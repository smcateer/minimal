Abstract: We are often told that solvable nonlinear differential equations are rare - if you write down a random nonlinear DE, it's an extremely safe bet that it's not going to be solvable. We are then presented with a solvable example and we stand rightly in awe. Where did it come from? How does it have any right to be? In this talk I will follow a discussion presented in a manuscript by M. Noumi & T Takebe. Lots of solvable nonlinear DEs are constructed in a reasonably pedestrian manner. If time permits, I will also discuss other interesting results presented in the manuscript.

(Talk given for the graduate student seminar series on 29 January 2010).
