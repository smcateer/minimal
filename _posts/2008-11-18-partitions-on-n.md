Abstract: A probability distribution, which is related to *hook length*, is defined for the set of partitions of a given number \\(n\\). We then ask questions about the expected shape of a partition for large \\(n\\). It turns out that the distribution concentrates on a partition whose Young diagram has a boundary of a particular simple shape.
