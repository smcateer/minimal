“In the right notation, the truth is obvious.” — Arun Ram (paraphrase)

Tensors are a generalization of matrices with lots of indices instead of just 2. In diagrammatic tensor notation\*, a tensor is represented as a shape and its indices are represented as lines coming out of the shape. Difficult algebraic manipulation of tensors becomes the process of pushing the shapes around a page. I will describe DTN and how it is useful for doing calculations in quantum lattice models (the topic of my PhD).
