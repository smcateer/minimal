Abstract: In 1996 Maillet and Sanchez de Santos introduced the factorising \\(F\\)-matrix (really a tensor). This tensor factorises products of \\(R\\)-tensors indexed by permutations (the ubiquitous transfer matrix and indeed entire lattices of \\(R\\)-tensors are in this class. In this talk I define and describe some properties of the factorising \\(F\\)-tensors using diagrammatic tensor notation.
