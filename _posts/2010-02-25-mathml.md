Abstract: \\(\\mathrm{\\LaTeX}\\) has been a staple of mathematical publication for a some time now, however it is not designed with online publication in mind. Enter MathML; Mathematical Markup Language. MathML produces beautiful mathematics, fully integrated into a webpage. I will give a brief introduction into the language, by the end of which audience members should be able to start creating their own gorgeous mathematical webpages without the need to link to a PDF every time a formula appears. I will also discuss some other advantages MathML has over other standards such as searchability and ease of production.
